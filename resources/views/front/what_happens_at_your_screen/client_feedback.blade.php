                        Cancer Early Detection Centre regularly invites clients to submit feedback about their recent breast screening experience by completing a Client Feedback Survey online.

                    <h4>
                        Why we collect client feedback?
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Client Feedback Surveys are essential in helping us to understand your breast screening experience and needs.
                        By looking at survey results and feedback, we can identify things we are doing well and highlight areas that need improving.
                        Collecting and using client feedback is also an organisational priority for Cancer Early Detection centre.

                        Is it compulsory to fill the survey?

                    <p>
                        Participating in the survey is voluntary. We encourage everyone to complete it.
                        Your feedback is essential and will be used to help improve Cancer early detection services in the future.
                        If you choose not to complete the survey, this will not affect your invitation for your next breast screening appointment.
