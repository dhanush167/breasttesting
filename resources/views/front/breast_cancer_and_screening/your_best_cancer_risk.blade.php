                            Other than being female, age is the most significant factor for developing breast cancer.
                            The risk of breast cancer increases with age up to 75 years.
                            Over 75% of all breast cancers in Sri Lanka are diagnosed in women when they are aged 50 years or over.
                            The average age of the first diagnosis of breast cancer in women is 61.

                            Breast cancer is common, and most breast cancers are not caused by genetic factors.
                            Therefore most women's family history of breast cancer is due to chance alone.
                            For a small number of women with a family history,
                            this may be due to a gene change in a blood relative that increased the risk of cancer.

                            A family history of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

                        <p>
                            Risks are higher as more relatives are affected by the various cancers, and if a woman also has relatives affected by breast cancer.

                            Benign breast disease is a broad group of conditions with non-cancerous changes in breast tissue.
                            A history of proliferative benign breast disease is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
                            These conditions include LCIS, ADH, and ALH. BreastScreen Victoria offers yearly screening for women with these conditions.
