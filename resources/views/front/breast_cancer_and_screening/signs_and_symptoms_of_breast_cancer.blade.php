                            It is important that any symptoms or breast changes are properly investigated by your doctor.
                            This may include:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>physical examination of your breasts</li>
                            <li>mammogram</li>
                            <li>other tests that may be required</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            It is important to be breast aware because breast cancer can develop at any time. We recommend you get to know the normal look and feel of your breasts. If you find a breast change that is unusual for you, we recommend that should see your doctor without delay.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most breast changes are not due to cancer, but itâ€™s important to see a doctor to be sure.
                        </p>
