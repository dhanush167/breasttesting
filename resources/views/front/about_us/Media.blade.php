                        <p>
                            The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) was established in 1980 on the recommendations made by a World Health Organization (WHO) team to the Ministry of Health after a detailed study on mortality and morbidity of cancers in Sri Lanka.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            NCCP is the national focal point for prevention and control of cancers in the country. It is also responsible for policy, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation of prevention and control of cancers and conducting surveillance of cancers and facilitating research related to cancer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            NCCP coordinates with all cancer treatment centres, national level institutes (Eg. Family Health Bureau) and provincial health ministries to implement cancer control activities in Sri Lanka.
