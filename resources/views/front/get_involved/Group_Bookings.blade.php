                            Group bookings are a great way to support your community to have a breast screen.
                            Perhaps you work with a group of people who may need some extra support to screen,
                            or you are part of a club that would like to screen together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Group bookings are just like regular breast screen appointments.
                            The difference is approximately 4-10 appointments are booked on behalf of a group.
                             This allows the group to attend their appointment together and support each other.
                        </p>

                                The benefits of group bookings include:

                            <li>&#8226; Group bookings are more private</li>
                            <li>&#8226; Group members have more time to ask staff questions and debrief after their screen</li>
                        </ul>
